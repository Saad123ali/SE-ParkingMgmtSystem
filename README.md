# SE-ParkingMgmtSystem

A fully documented Parking Management System developed in C++ as a comprehensive project for a Software Engineering (SE) course. This system follows the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including planning, analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases, to ensure an efficient and maintainable solution for managing parking spaces.

## Features

- **Real-time Parking Space Management**: Track available and occupied parking spots.
- **Vehicle Entry/Exit Management**: Monitor and log vehicle entry and exit times.
- **User Authentication**: Role-based access control for system security.
- **Data Logging and Reporting**: Generate logs and reports for system monitoring.

## SDLC Phases Covered

1. **Planning**: Requirements gathering and project objectives.
2. **Analysis**: Detailed requirements and feasibility analysis.
3. **Design**: UML diagrams, system architecture, and flowcharts.
4. **Implementation**: C++ code implementation for all core features.
5. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and bug fixes.
6. **Maintenance**: Guidelines for system updates and modifications.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Database**: File handling or SQL database integration (optional)
- **Development Tools**: IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)
